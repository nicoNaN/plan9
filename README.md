# plan9
Plan 9 from Bell Labs

# Purpose
I forked the plan9 repo to study the source code and make notes.

Although [9front](http://9front.org) is actively developed, I won't be able to contribute without understanding of the original Plan 9 :)

I'll be making notes on individual files or directories as I study the code. Additionally, I'll be taking notes from various resources and placing them in the `/notes` folder.
